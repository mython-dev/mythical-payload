## What payload is
>In computing, a payload is the carrying capacity of a packet or other transmission data unit. The term has its roots in the military and is often associated with the capacity of executable malicious code to do damage. The term payload has two meanings: data payload, which is related to the transport of data across a network, and malware payload, which refers to malicious code used to exploit and compromise IT networks and systems.
